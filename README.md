I'm currently building this app with nodejs 6.x

### Installation

```npm install```

## Development
### Run In Development mode

```npm start```

App should be running in http://localhost:8080

When you make changes a watcher will rebuild the app and you may need to refresh the page to see the changes.

```npm run build```

## Running the build (having already run `npm run build`)

```npm run serve```
